# Internet Dude Doing Internet Things!
Self taught Full Stack developer, specialising in the FE.
I have over 16 years in industry, being lucky enough to work with some of the World's biggest musicians, creative brands and products.
I love the web, and belive in a free, open and accessable internet for everyone, everywhere.

This github is purely for learning/personal pet projects.

Not looking for work opportunities - but always open to contribute to fun OS projects.

I have little free time, I apologise if I attempt to contribute to something then get pulled away - such is life.
