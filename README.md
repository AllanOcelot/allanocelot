# Internet Dude Doing Internet Things!
Full stack, FE specalist, with 16 years in industry.
I've been lucky enough to work with some of the World's biggest musicians, creative brands, products and services.


I love the web, and belive in a free, open and accessable internet for everyone, everywhere.

Not looking for work opportunities - This github is purely for learning/personal pet projects.

# Other stuff
I have little free time, I apologise if I attempt to contribute to something then get pulled away - such is life.
